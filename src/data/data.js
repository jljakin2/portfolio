      "Solving real-world problems using software is my favorite thing about learning to code. This project stemmed from that passion. My organization has a mentoring program. Mentors and mentees are able to use an application to pair with each other. The problem was, the application had limited functionality and the license was expensive. Due to these reasons, my organization decided to cancel the license. I saw the opportunity to build a custom application that provided better functionality. Plus, since it was internal, the data privacy would improve as well. I was able to deploy the app using our internal cloud and Cloud Foundry.",
      "The app uses Node.js for the server-side. Express for all route handling. And the app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Most of the styling is from Bootstrap and a few items were custom designed and styled using CSS. A REST API manages the data that feeds into a Mongo Database. The app uses Pug to render data on the front end.",

        . Frontend Mentor is a site that supplies UI designs so users can code
        the designs without support or tutorials. The challenges range from
        ‚ÄúNewbie‚Äù to ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù. This project rates as one of the most challenging
        projects on the platform.

      "I used the MERN stack to complete this project. React allowed me to build a scalable front-end experience for the user. I also used Redux to help with the state management. All elements were custom styled using Styled Components. I built the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also built a REST API  for the front-end and back-end to communicate.  I used Redux-Thunk to request data to feed into the global state so each React component can get access to it.",
