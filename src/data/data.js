      "Solving real-world problems using software is my favorite thing about learning to code. This project stemmed from that passion. My organization has a mentoring program. Mentors and mentees are able to use an application to pair with each other. The problem was, the application had limited functionality and the license was expensive. Due to these reasons, my organization decided to cancel the license. I saw the opportunity to build a custom application that provided better functionality. Plus, since it was internal, the data privacy would improve as well. I was able to deploy the app using our internal cloud and Cloud Foundry.",
      "The app uses Node.js for the server-side. Express for all route handling. And the app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Most of the styling is from Bootstrap and a few items were custom designed and styled using CSS. A REST API manages the data that feeds into a Mongo Database. The app uses Pug to render data on the front end.",

        projects on the platform.

All elements were custom styled using Styled Components. I built the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also built a REST API  for the front-end and back-end to communicate.  I used Redux-Thunk to request data to feed into the global state so each React component can get access to it.",

I stored all of the data in a MongoDB which is hooked up to a GraphQL API. I used Apollo on the front-end to connect to the GraphQL API. Lastly, I used KeystoneJS as a headless CMS so you can easily manage the back-end data via the simple CMS UI.",
